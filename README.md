- 👋 Hi, I’m @JacquesVanHeerden and on Call of Duty I'm known as DefConGuy.
- 👀 I’m interested in Cyber Security and more specifically in the field of Offensive Security and penetration testing
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HackTheBox's Penetration Testing Path as well as a B.Sc IT Degree at Northwest University in Potchefstroom
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Ethical Hacking, Encryption Projects, anything Cyber related really!
- 📫 How to reach me jvanheerden38@gmail.com - Please do not bother sending Phishing emails ;)

The top 3 career options I chose was:
1. Chief Information Security Officer - CISO
2. Cybersecurity Engineer
3. Penetration Tester

Given my desire, experience and skills I chose to start with Penetration Tester and will try to accumulate my OSCP and B.Sc IT Degree by 2027

Stay tuned for more updates.
