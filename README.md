Story Time:

Once upon a time, back in high school, I uploaded a BATCH file to an 'unsecured fileserver' with my nickname at the time, Pushups.bat. This file was in a directory that only teachers were supposed to have access to - the IT teacher then clicked on it, and Pushups displayed in multiple colors flashing on the screen (a completely harmless file, by the way). I then got called in and had to explain what I did and why I did it (Mostly it was out of curiosity but the teachers did not believe that), nonetheless, I knew there was access to something that I was not supposed to have access to. The IT guy fixed the NTFS permissions, lol. It was not my fault that it was exposed - I just pointed out the issue, anyway, I got detention. After this, I did some more research on this scenario and found that there are careers like this called "Ethical hacker", White Hat Hacker, Penetration Tester, etc. I then decided that after high school, I wanted to be in IT Security - I did my research, and I'm still in the process of becoming an ethical hacker.

Fast Forward:
The top 3 career options I chose:
1. Chief Information Security Officer - CISO
2. Cybersecurity Engineer
3. Penetration Tester

Given my desire, experience, and skills I chose to start with Penetration Tester and will try to accumulate my CISSP and B.Sc IT Degree by 2027

Stay tuned for more updates. (My timeline might look a little empty until 2026 due to my determined focus on the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology degree I am pursuing).
Hack The Box updates might be seen during the holiday seasons... (It's more like a hobby at this stage)
