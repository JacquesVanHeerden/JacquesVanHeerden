Story Time:
Once upon a time back in highschool I uploaded a BATCH file to an 'unsecure fileserver' with my nickname at the time 'Pushups.bat' this file was in a directory where only teachers where supposed to have access to - the IT teacher then clicked on it and Pushups displayed in multiple colours flashing on the screen (a completely harmless file btw) I then got called in and had to explain - obviously I did not know much about security or 'ethical hacking' but I knew that I there was access to something it was not my fault that it was exposed - I simply just pointed out the issue, nonetheless - I got detention and the IT guy fixed the NTFS permissions, lol. After this I did some more research on this scenario and found that there are careers like this called "Ethical hacker", White Hat Hacker, Penetration Tester, etc. I then decided that after highschool I want to be in IT Security - did my research and I'm still in the process of becoming an ethical hacker.

Fast Forward:
The top 3 career options I chose:
1. Chief Information Security Officer - CISO
2. Cybersecurity Engineer
3. Penetration Tester

Given my desire, experience and skills I chose to start with Penetration Tester and will try to accumulate my OSCP and B.Sc IT Degree by 2027

Stay tuned for more updates.
